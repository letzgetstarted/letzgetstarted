## 🧭 About Me

My toolkit includes .NET, Python, Go, and JavaScript/TypeScript with React, Angular, Vue.js, and Node.js, making me a versatile force across both infrastructure and software development.  

I’m a DevOps maestro with a flair for turning operational chaos into a symphony of automation and efficiency. Whether it’s DevOps, AIOps, CloudOps, DevSecOps, AppOps, ChatOps, MLOps, NoOps, AnalyticsOps, DataOps, GitOps, InfraOps, or even ModelOps—if it has an ‘Ops’ in it, I’ve probably mastered it.  

I build rock-solid CI/CD pipelines, architect scalable cloud solutions in Azure, AWS, and GCP, and orchestrate seamless deployments with Docker and Kubernetes. From APIs to ETL, database optimization to observability, I bring production-grade discipline and speed to every project.

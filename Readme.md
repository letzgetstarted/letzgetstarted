## 🧭 About Me

With over a decade of experience across software engineering and DevOps, I specialize in building secure, scalable, and automated systems that span cloud platforms, codebases, and containers.  

From modernizing legacy .NET applications to engineering high-availability Kubernetes infrastructure, I help teams deliver robust, production-ready systems—faster and with greater confidence.

If it runs on .NET, lives in the cloud, deploys through GitHub Actions, and scales with Terraform and Kubernetes—I’ve probably built it, secured it, and automated it end-to-end.

## ⚙️ What I Do

✅ Architect and scale .NET Core and Go-based microservices  
✅ Build secure CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and ArgoCD  
✅ Automate infrastructure using Terraform, Pulumi, and Bicep  
✅ Design multi-cloud deployments on Azure, AWS, and GCP  
✅ Implement end-to-end observability with Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK  
✅ Harden systems using DevSecOps tooling and IAM best practices  
✅ Deliver full-stack solutions using React, Angular, and TypeScript  
✅ Mentor engineering teams on clean code, security, and cloud architecture
